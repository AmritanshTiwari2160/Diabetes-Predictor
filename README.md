# Diabetes Predictor
The Diabetes Predictor leverages machine learning algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health metrics. This tool is designed to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in making early and informed health decisions.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following pretrained models:
- `Diabetes_model_all.pkl`
- `Diabetes_model_knn.pkl`
- `Diabetes_model_randomforest.pkl`
- `Diabetes_model_xgbclassifier.pkl`

**Note**: Due to size constraints, two models - `Diabetes_model_all` and `Diabetes_model_randomforest` are not included in the repository.<br>
